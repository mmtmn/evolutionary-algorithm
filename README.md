  In this script, the bricklayer's graph is constructed to resemble the way a bricklayer would fill in a Hamming graph. The maximal robustness is calculated using the relationship between genotypes, and the sums-of-digits function is applied as described in the abstract.

This script offers a more abstract and conceptual representation of the concepts described. Further development may include specific models for RNA secondary structure and the hydrophobic-polar (HP) model for protein folding, as these would require more detailed biological and mathematical modeling.
